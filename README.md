# 🧬 Disease Prediction from Medical Data

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of the following diseases based on medical data:

- **Diabetes**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Breast Cancer**

Each dataset undergoes preprocessing, training with four classification models, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## 📊 Datasets Used

- `diabetes.csv` — PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
- `heart.csv` — Heart Disease UCI Dataset
- `data.csv` — Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
